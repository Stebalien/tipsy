PlugIn Name : The Content Injection 1.0
Author : Aashish Das 
Catch me at - www.fb.com/ashlife24

Description : This is very very simple plugin to insert Custom Codes/Text/HTML/whatever before and after the main content of your
	      blog post. it will add Custom Codes/Text/HTML/whatever right before the content and right after the content.

Why to Use - Personally searched for a simple plugin to do the same, but all have many unwanted settings and other options making it feel like its ready for a space shuttle launch, making the work confusing and reducind page load time, effecting traffic.
so, coded this plugin simple as something can be. 

Free to use and distribute, Free to edit, but credits demanded. :P

your's truly,
